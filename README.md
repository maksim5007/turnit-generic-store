## Technical
Database layer is implemented using NHibernate and PostgreSQL database.

Application can be run with docker compose `docker-compose up` (docker-compose file is in the root directory). Application is exposed on the port 5000 and PostgreSQL is exposed on port 5632.

When running application locally (without docker, in dev environment), 
docker compose can be used to serve database and then can use connection string:
`Server=localhost;Port=5632;Database=turnit_store;User ID=postgres;Password=postgres`.

Application image can be built with (when using with docker-compose) `docker-compose build web`.
